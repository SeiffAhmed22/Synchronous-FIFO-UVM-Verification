# Synchronous-FIFO-UVM-Verification
This repository contains the UVM-based verification of a Synchronous FIFO. It includes constrained random stimulus generation, functional coverage, and a reference model to check outputs. UVM assertions are used to ensure the correct behavior of flags and counters, focusing on comprehensive validation of the FIFO's functionality.
